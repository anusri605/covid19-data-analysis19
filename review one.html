   <h2>Corona virus origin</h2>
  <div class="messagebox shadow" id="corona virus origin">
    <ul>
<li><strong>WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF COVID 19?</strong> It is believed to have zoonotic origins and has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses, suggesting it emerged from a bat-borne virus. There is no evidence yet to link an intermediate animal reservoir, such as a pangolin, to its introduction to humans.

The virus shows little genetic diversity, indicating that the spillover event introducing SARS-CoV-2 to humans is likely to have occurred in late 2019. Epidemiological studies estimate each infection results in 1.4 to 3.9 new ones when no members of the community are immune and no preventive measures taken.</li>
      <br>

<li><strong>EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES</strong> estimate each infection results in 1.4 to 3.9 new ones when no members of the community are immune and no preventive measures taken. The virus primarily spreads between people through close contact and via respiratory droplets produced from coughs or sneezes. It mainly enters human cells by binding to the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>corona virus symtoms</h2>
  <div class="messagebox shadow" id="coronavirussymptoms">
    
    <ul>
<li><strong>symptoms and riks</strong> It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact. Infections range from mild to deadly.

SARS-CoV-2 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The other coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but aren’t a serious threat for otherwise healthy people.</li>
<li>Put <strong>distance between yourself and other</strong> <strong>people</strong> if COVID-19 is spreading in your community. This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.</li>
</ul>
    </div>
      
 

<h2>deaths by corona in india</h2>
      <div class="messagebox shadow" id="deathsbycoronainindia">
        
        <li><strong>When calculating the mortality rate, we need:</strong> The number of actual cases. We need to know the number of actual cases (not merely the reported ones, which are typically only a small portion of the actual ones) that have already had an outcome (positive or negative: recovery or death), not the current cases that still have to resolve (the case sample shall contain zero active cases and include only "closed" cases).
The number of actual deaths related to the closed cases examined above.</li>
<li>Considering that a large number of cases are asymptomatic (or present with very mild symptoms) and that testing has not been performed on the entire population, only a fraction of the SARS-CoV-2 infected population is detected, confirmed through a laboratory test, and officially reported as a COVID-19 case. The number of actual cases is therefore estimated to be at several multiples above the number of reported cases. The number of deaths also tends to be underestimated, as some patients are not hospitalized and not tested.

If we base our calculation (deaths / cases) on the number of reported cases (rather than on the actual ones), we will greatly overestimate the fatality rate.</li>

      <div class="messagebox shadow" id="virus2.0ofcorona">
        
        <ul>
<li><strong> virus 2.0 of corona</strong> India is currently facing the first wave of COVID- 19 and if steps are not taken by the Government of India to curb the spread of COVID-19 at the earliest, India will soon witness the second wave of COVID-19 which is basically the disastrous situation the developed nations are undergoing at present. Corona Virus 2.0 will be worse and our country will find it difficult to face such a situation.</li>
          
          <li><strong>virus with no symptoms </strong>the virus may exists in your body but it wont show any symptoms in you if your imunity is good but it gets speard to others you communicate to and may be fatal for others  </li>

  <div class="messagebox shadow" id="Cleanyourhand">
    <ul>
<li><strong>clean your hand</strong> often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
      <br>
<li>If soap and water are not readily available, <strong>use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol</strong>. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.</li>
      <br>
<li><strong>clean your hand</strong> <strong>your eyes, nose, and mouth</strong> with unwashed hands.

<h2>avoid close contact</h2>
  <div class="messagebox shadow" id="avoidclosecontact">
    
    <ul>
<li><strong>avoid close contact</strong> with people who are sick</li>

<h2>stay home</h2>
      <div class="messagebox shadow" id="StayHome">

<li><strong>Throw used tissues</strong> in the trash.</li>
<li>Immediately <strong>wash your hands</strong> with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>

      <h2>Wear A Facemask</h2>
      <div class="messagebox shadow" id="WearAFacemask">
        
        <ul>
<li><strong>If you are sick:</strong> You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room.</li>
          
          <li><strong>If you are NOT sick: </strong>You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.</li>
